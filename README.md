## Self-Assessment <br/>
In Daisy’s Credit Card Approval  project I was responsible for ReadMe and Google Slides as well. My biggest challenge was working with team because of language barrier. <br/>
## Team Assessment <br/>
#### Communication protocols <br/>
To effective group collaboration & teamwork we’ve done following: <br/>
•	Defined each role, <br/>
•	Created direct messages for only team members in Slack. <br/>
## Summary of Project <br/>
Commercial banks receive a lot of applications for credit cards. Many of them get rejected for many reasons, like high loan balances, low-income levels, or too many inquiries on an individual’s credit report, for example. Manually analyzing these applications is mundane, error-prone, and time-consuming. Fortunately, this task can be automated with the power of machine learning, and pretty much every commercial bank does so nowadays. In Credit Card Approval  project, we built an automatic credit card approval predictor using Random Forest classification algorithm. <br/>
We got 92% prediction accuracy. <br/>
